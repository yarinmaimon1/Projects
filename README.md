CHECKER – Automated Attack Simulation Tool
Overview
CHECKER is a Bash-based penetration testing tool designed to automate network reconnaissance and attack simulations. It integrates Nmap, Hydra, and Arpspoof to test security monitoring capabilities and assess SIEM detection effectiveness.

Features
✔ Port Scanning – Uses Nmap to identify open ports and running services.
✔ Brute Force Attacks – Automates authentication testing with Hydra (FTP, SSH, Telnet, etc.).
✔ Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attacks – Employs Arpspoof to intercept network traffic.
✔ Attack Randomization – Allows dynamic selection of attack types for better testing coverage.
✔ Logging & Analysis – Generates logs for auditing and reviewing SOC/SIEM responses.

Disclaimer
This tool is for educational and authorized security testing only. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own is illegal.

PT Project – Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool
Overview
PT_project.sh is a Bash script designed for penetration testing and security assessments. It automates network scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability identification using Nmap, Masscan, Hydra, and SearchSploit. This tool helps evaluate SOC monitoring capabilities and identify security weaknesses.

Features
✔ Network Scanning – Uses Nmap and Masscan to detect open ports and services.
✔ Vulnerability Analysis – Employs SearchSploit to find known exploits for discovered services.
✔ Password Auditing – Leverages Hydra for brute-force attacks on SSH, FTP, RDP, and Telnet.
✔ Custom Wordlists – Supports user-imported lists or generates passwords dynamically using Crunch.
✔ Automated Logging & Reporting – Saves all findings for further analysis.
✔ Flexible Scanning Options – Provides Basic and Full scan modes for different depth levels.

Disclaimer
This tool is intended for ethical hacking and authorized security testing only. Unauthorized use against systems without explicit permission is illegal.
